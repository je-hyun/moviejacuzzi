>Our project will be a database to model movies and user reviews for a movie. Movies will have associated information about release year, title, and runtime, and have relationship with its crew members. With the database, we can make queries based on movie data and reviews as well as insert reviews into the database. The relevant entities include movie, movie_person, actor, director, producer, writer, music_producer, genre, user, and review. To break down the m:n relationships, there will also be movie_actor, movie_director, movie_producer, movie_writer, movie_genre entities. -- <cite>MovieJacuzzi Project Proposal</cite>
